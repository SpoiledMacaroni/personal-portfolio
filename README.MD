Welcome to my portfolio site repository!

This personal site includes the following:

- An "About" section with a short paragraph describing the person who built the portfolio site, that may include a picture of them.
- A "Projects" section that showcases some of my projects, and includes a link to a live demo (which houses a link to the source code) 
- Links to all my social media for the purpose of contacting me!
